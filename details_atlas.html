      <div class="col-lg-8" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p> The development of Atlas fully embraced the Goal-Directed Design (GDD) method, a systematic approach crafted
          by Alan Cooper.
          GDD was the cornerstone of our design process from inception to completion.
          Typically, this process starts with stakeholder and kickoff meetings and culminates in the final product.
          Given the 16-week timeframe of our Spring semester, we adapted GDD to fit our project's timeline.
          We diligently followed these phases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reseach</strong>: Understanding users and the domain.</li>
          <li><strong>Modeling</strong>: Creating user personas and context of use.</li>
          <li><strong>Requirements</strong>: Identifying and defining the needs of users, business, and technology.</li>
          <li><strong>Framework</strong>Framework: Establishing the design's structure and workflow.</li>
          <li><strong>Refinement</strong>: Enhancing behaviors, aesthetics, and content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The primary objective of this design approach was to ensure that the app aligns with user goals at every
          stage.
          The subsequent sections offer an in-depth exploration of each phase, emphasizing how they collectively
          contribute to creating a user-centric and goal-oriented design.

    <section id="research">
      <div class="col-lg-8" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Kickoff Meeting</strong>:<br>
          In our simulated Kickoff Meeting for the Atlas app, we initially targeted budget-conscious college students
          for our travel app, later expanding to a broader audience including business travelers and leisure seekers.
          This phase involved formulating a problem statement and assumptions, with a focus on developing unique
          features for budget-friendly and efficient travel planning, while ensuring the app's interface caters to the
          diverse needs of our expanded user base.<br><br>

          <strong>Literature Review</strong>:<br>
          Our Literature Review delved into the psychology of travel and generational preferences, aligning travel
          motivations with Maslow's hierarchy of needs and highlighting differences between Gen Z's eco-conscious,
          experience-driven travel and Millennials' resource-enabled frequent travels. This research guides our app's
          development to address varied traveler needs, considering factors like age, travel objectives, and time
          constraints, aiming for a universally appealing and functional travel experience.<br><br>

          <strong>Competitive Audit</strong>:<br>
          The Competitive Audit analyzed major travel apps like Airbnb and Kayak, identifying gaps in user experience
          enhancements.
          We also explored niche apps like AllTrails and Naver, understanding the importance of a multi-start search
          route and detailed filters in our app.
          The findings from this audit, along with simulated stakeholder inputs, inform our design strategy to integrate
          comprehensive booking options and target a diverse user base, measuring success through user engagement and
          profitability.<br><br>

          <strong>User Research</strong>:<br>
          In the User Research phase, our team broadened the target audience using persona hypothesis templates and
          engaged in interviews with travel enthusiasts, aiming to tailor the Atlas app to genuine user requirements.
          This phase emphasized the crucial distinction between the objectives of designers and the needs of users,
          guiding us to create a product that genuinely resonates with users by comprehending their thought processes
          and interactions with travel products.
          The insights gathered from these interviews were instrumental in forming a user-focused and pragmatic design
          approach. Moreover, this phase highlighted the value of empathetic design, as understanding and incorporating
          user feedback was key to refining our app's functionality and usability.

    <!-- Modeling -->
    <section id="modeling">
      <div class="col-lg-8" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
        <h2>Modeling</h2>
        <p>
          In the Modeling Phase, our team analyzed interview data to identify patterns and define user goals, leading to
          the creation of user personas. These personas, Marvin and Madeline, were crafted based on common behaviors and
          preferences found in our research. Marvin, our Primary Persona, is driven by the desire for unique experiences
          and cultural learning, aiming to visit numerous places. Madeline, our Secondary Persona, seeks a balance
          between work and leisure travel, focusing on business efficiency and accumulating travel rewards for personal
          trips. Our design primarily addresses Marvin's needs while also accommodating Madeline's, ensuring both
          personas' goals are met without compromise.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Behavioral Variables and Identifying Patterns</strong><br>
            Following the GDD phases, we
            identified variables during our interviews. These variables are patterns found throughout the interviews,
            including type of traveling, frequency of traveling, and how interviewees plan for their trips. Here is an
            initial map of these variables</li><br>
          <li>In the user research phase, the team analyzed interview data from five users, identifying two distinct
            clusters of travel preferences. The first cluster (1&3), labeled as pink, consisted of leisure travelers who
            often travel, seek unique experiences, plan trips quickly, and prioritize uniqueness in their travels. This
            group's flexible and spontaneous travel style led to their characteristics being chosen for our Primary
            Persona. The second cluster (4&5), labeled as green, represented business travelers who typically stay in
            hotels, travel less frequently, and are meticulous planners. Despite their enjoyment of travel, their
            detailed-oriented approach to trip planning resulted in their characteristics defining our Secondary
            Persona. These insights were crucial in developing personas that accurately reflect the diverse needs and
            behaviors of our target users.
          </li><br>
          <li><strong>Defining Persona Goals</strong><br>
            Upon identifying behavior patterns and Persona goals, the team progressed to constructing the Personas.
            Utilizing a random name generator, we distilled the identified clusters into specific bullet points, clearly
            defining the end goals for both the Primary and Secondary Personas. This step was crucial as it provided
            clear direction for the app's development, aligning its features and functionalities with the specific needs
            and aspirations of these Personas. This process of defining Persona goals effectively laid the groundwork
            for the subsequent Requirements Phase, ensuring a targeted and user-centric approach in our app design.

        <h2>**ADD PICS** Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          In the Modeling Phase, the team broke down the Requirements Phase into key steps to refine our app, Atlas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Problem and Vision Statements:</strong><br>
            Problem Statement
            (From the stakeholder perspective)
            The current state of the traveling apps has focused primarily to help users find affordable and efficient
            traveling options. Services such as: Airbnb, Kayak and TripAdvisor fail to directly address a user’s time
            frame and overall travel budget (transportation, place to stay, food etc.) Our product/service will address
            this gap by allowing the user to search based on their budget and time available.
          </li><br>

          <li><strong>Vision Statement:</strong><br>
            From the user’s perspective, The new design of Atlas will help users achieve planning a trip by allowing
            them to plan based off their time
            and budget, with greater efficiency, and without problems of search limitations that they currently
            experience. This will dramatically improve Atlas’ customer satisfaction ratings which will lead user’s to
            our product. (BP)</li><br>

          <li><strong>Persona Expectations</strong><br>
            By integrating Persona needs with Problem and Vision Statements, we defined what Atlas should ideally offer
            to both Primary and Secondary Personas in terms of data and functional needs. (PP - primary , BP - both)

        <h2>**ADD PICS** Frameworks</h2>
        <p>
          In the Frameworks Phase, our team focused on constructing a low-fidelity wireframe of the app using Figjam. We
          started with a Key Path Scenario, marked in red, to outline the most common and crucial journey of the Primary
          Persona through the app. This scenario was pivotal in highlighting the app's essential features and
          functionalities. Additionally, we integrated multiple Validation Scenarios, shown in purple, into the
          wireframe. These scenarios addressed the less frequently used features of the app, contributing to a richer
          user experience. This phase was crucial for establishing the app's foundational structure, enabling us to
          identify and rectify potential issues early in the design process. The low-fidelity wireframe served as a
          visual guide to understand the app's flow and page organization, setting a clear path for further refinement
          and development in subsequent phases.

        <p>
          In the Refinement Phase of our project, the team undertook two key usability tests to assess the prototype's
          effectiveness and user-friendliness. These tests revealed several areas for improvement. Notably, color
          adjustments were necessary to enhance user experience, and the addition of extra screens was identified as a
          requirement to emulate a more authentic booking process. The team's focus in this phase was on refining these
          elements to ensure that the final product not only met the project's requirements but also provided an optimal
          and seamless user experience.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In my first experience with Goal Directed Design (GDD), I learned valuable lessons about the intricacies and
          challenges of the design process. Recognizing the importance of each phase in GDD, I found that skipping any
          step could significantly impact the final outcome. Central to this approach was the user research interviews,
          which form the foundation of app development.<br><br>
          Key Learnings:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Leadership Challenges: Leading a team for the first time in a GDD project presented difficulties. Despite
            having a supportive professor, I often felt lost and realized the importance of asking even the smallest
            questions throughout the process.</li>
          <li>Research Interview Missteps: Under time pressure, I expedited the interview process without a specific
            demographic focus, leading to a less targeted approach in app development. In hindsight, focusing on college
            students as our primary demographic would have aligned better with Atlas's initial concept.</li>
          <li>Design Conflicts: Some aspects of the Atlas app, particularly certain pages, seem visually incomplete.
            This issue might have been mitigated with more time for refinement and development.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These experiences have been instrumental in shaping my understanding of the GDD process and the critical role
          of thorough, focused research and thoughtful leadership in successful app design.
